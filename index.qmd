# Data Science in the Biomedical Science

## Data Science Programs Are Too General

- Data science programs target **single broad audiences**
- Opportunity to **branch out** to different disciplines
- Democratization of data science education enables more **domain specific** learning materials


## Informatics Interest Outpace Opportunities

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/020-ds-biomed//banerjee-2015-interest_outpace_opportunities.png")
```

- Students who are interested in a clinical informatics related career
- Not aware of training opportunities
- Need to increase: quantity, quality, and publicity

## Backward Design Learning Materials

1. Identify your learners (learner persona)
2. Plan out your lesson content (concept maps)
3. Define overall goal (summative assessment)
4. Break down the goal (formative assessment)
5. Outline the course
6. Write a summary of the course

# Identification of Biomedical Data Science Learner Persons

Implications and Lessons Learned for Domain-Specific Data Science Curriculum

## What are Personas?

- Come from product design
- Detailed description of an imaginary person
- Embodies assumptions of the user and product
- Cannot and should not represent every possible user

<span class="small>
Pruitt J, Adlin T. The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design. 1st edition. Morgan Kaufmann; 2006.
</span>

## Why use personas in education?

- Minimize **discrepancies** on how people understand and communicate about users
- Make implicit assumptions **explicit**
- Stay focused on the **users** (user centric design)

<span class="small>
Pruitt J, Adlin T. The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design. 1st edition. Morgan Kaufmann; 2006.
</span>

## Creating a "Wrong" Persona

- Still backed by data
- "Product"is still consistent
- Personas are a work in progress

<span class="small">
Pruitt J, Adlin T. The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design. 1st edition. Morgan Kaufmann; 2006.

## Creating Learner Personas

- Self-assessment survey (33 questions)
- Clustered to identify personas (23 Questions)
- 2 Waves (N=67): Summer 2020 (N=51) + Summer 2021

1. Demographics (6)
1. Programs Used in the Past (1)
1. Programming Experience (6)
1. Data Cleaning and Processing Experience (4)

## Teaching Tech Together: The Rules

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. Be kind: all else is details.
2. Remember that you are not your learners…
3. …that most people would rather fail than change…
4. …and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.
5. Never teach alone.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
7. Make every mistake a lesson.
8. Remember that no lesson survives first contact with learners…
9. …that every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner…
10. …and that nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
